                        <p class="content-load-description">50% of website users bounce off the page it it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 sec to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll website loaded within a few seconds.</p>
